# Section-2 Notes
## Characteristics of Good Design in Code

### Is it efficient?

Avoid unnecessary **repetition** & **redundant operations**.

### Is it easy to maintain?

* **Prototype** functions at the top, above `main()`.
* Avoid **"magic numbers."** (i.e., hard-coded numbers).
If a value will not change throughout the program it should be defined as a **constant**.

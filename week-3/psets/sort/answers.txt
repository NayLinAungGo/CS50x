sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:
* Very fast with sorted txt
* Takes a significantly longer duration with reversed and even more with random txt
Bubble sort's best case scenario is sorted text where it wouldn't need to make any changes.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
* Takes the least duration out of all sort programs with all txt
Merge sort's performs the same in both best case and worst case scenarios
and Merge is known to be the fastest sorter at θ(n log n) and sort2 is the fastest sorter out of all.


sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: 
* Takes quite a long duration with all txt
Selection sort's best and worst case scenarios are exactly the same.
The Θ(n^2) appears to be at work here.
